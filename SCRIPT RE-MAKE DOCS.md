# ROUGHBALL TABLETOP VS. ROUGHBALL ASCII
- HANDBOOK + TEMPLATES + GAME ASSETS | MATCH SIMULATION + CARDS & DICE MECHANICS
- FORMATIONS, TOKENS AND PLAY SCHEMES | ASCII GRAPHICS + PLAY OUTCOME COMMENTARY
- PLAYER RATINGS, TRAITS AND BACKGROUNDS | DYNASTY BUILDING + SOLO FRANCHISE RUN
- DYNASTY MANAGEMENT + LOGBOOK TRACKING | DRAFT SIMULATION + ROSTER MANAGEMENT

> DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
> 1. HONOR ORIGINAL MECHANICS IN THE ORIGINAL HANDBOOK.
> 2. FOCUS ON THE GAMEPLAY THE SCRIPT TRIED PROVIDING...
> 3. USE ACTUAL PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED WORKING LOGIC!

# BUILD SCHEDULE
1°. WEEKEND PROTOTYPE: simplest viable loop: "audible" play phases and resolution, quick match, 
basic card system and stat comparisons, d66 window working correctly, clean console output.
2°. WEEK SPRINT: dynasty mode foundation in the form of weekly activities, 12 week "year" structure,
match days across a week, actual bonuses/penalties for activities, functional special moves/playbook
3°. MONTH BUILD: persistent tabletop game companion, all championship and tournament modes, working draft
system w/ jkr special positions, dual threat veteran + star ratings for roster management

# MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT FEATURES
 [1] QUICK MATCH -> input X amount of cards, resolve based on current team stats + division success window 
 following the mathematical ruling within the handbook, track scoring and posession flippages... to be always
 kept in mind however is that NO DOWNS OR YARDAGE ARE PRESENT IN ROUGHBALL! THIS IS A LIVE BALL GAME!!
 [2] FRANCHISE MODE -> log weekly activities, match results, bonuses and penalties to current stats, 
 calculate standings, track progression and "time" advancement for the REGIONAL BAD-BLOOD CHAMPIONSHIP RING.
 [3] THE DRAFT -> two "sub-modes" are present: drafting a full 8 man roster, and trading players around 
 if required in order to start a "brand new" franchise, or drafting 4 picks after the completion of a season 
 on DRAFT DAY as to update the value of a current roster, thus being also able to rebuild "unlucky" 
 previous drafts with new assets and trades from other teams based on their own picks!
 [4] FOUR NATIONS WORLD CUP -> an entirely separate game mode that simulates the 4-year process that involves 
 preparing for an international world cup of this calibre! the first year is simply simulated to determine 
 the previous loser (if the game was good, it would remember the previous loser!) and then proceed with the 
 drafting of the elite 8 man roster during the second year, along with a full third year of training camp & roster
 development, culminating on a fourth year actual FOUR NATIONS TOURNAMENT, following specific bracket structure.
 [5] CLUB WIPEOUT CROWN -> this is the only "orphan" game mode, because it requires you to run the "championship" 
 mode to see the actual best 4 teams per cardinal point within each nation before they qualify for the GLOBAL NATIONS
 OVERSEAS CROWN DUEL... (however they could just be randomized or cycled around lol)
 [6] SAVE & QUIT -> actually the most scary thing to implement is PLAYTHROUGH PERSISTENCE so that the game
 doesn't wipe everything away on every boot... but keeping track of the sheer amount of data this game generates 
 seems like a lot! keeping updated match recaps, draft reports and season summaries could get hefty.

# DESIGN PHILOSOPHY & "FLAVOR TOME"
> ROUGHBALL is a realistic visual sports strategy simulator that tries to capture the honor and
glory of the "gentleman's sport" and its values, in the sense that roughball management mimics
the "drama" and hard work of daily life in the league, on top of STAYING in the league 
(refer to popular tv shows: nfl hard knocks, or netflix last chance u). 
players sweat, cry and ache for their spots. coaches yell, hug and bleed to make sure their 
team comes on top of their performance every time, and the franchises "gamble everything" for
their teams to make sure they are able to deliver the results expected. it works as a well oiled machine,
that in the mean time develops strong bonds between members, deep heartbreak
after unexpected results, lucky strikes in the form of surprising draft picks or trades,
and the absolute fullfilment of reaching the goals you set for yourself or the team,
maybe 8 seasons ago, when you were still in that smelly locker room... you see the big picture?

* ROUGHBALL also caters to three types of "target audience": 
1. managerial nerds who love diving their noses into statistical paperwork. 
2. playcalling afficionados who will find the intra-match tacticts utterly supreme
3. old "nostalgia" player who wants to play a game such as this for a good time
 rolling dice around for their fantasy team 
(the secret fourth target audience would be an actual normal videogame consumer,
 but i don't think this game was made for them lol...)

- I can easily "visualize" those three kinds of guys playing roughball: 
1. a sports fan with a knack for statistic spreadsheets and trade economics (some experts call it "gambling" lmao). 
2. a retired american football coach flipping the table over a re-audible play gone awry for their veteran roughball team.
3. a young rugby player having a pint with his friends yelling over how the caranchos won twice the amount of rings as the yacarés 
(4. a young sister or brother seeing you hunched over fantasy spreadhseets right from outside your dormitory...
it might be 4am, and for the 7th time your sibling knows nothing about the "veteran wingbacker that played in
the millenium era for the lake brown seahawks..." but they still love you anyway i think)

* The GLOBAL NATIONS territory is deeply striken by individual morals and values from every culture spread across the globe:
- the UNITED SOUTH is a culture of gritty and passionate hard workers that love playing ball and fighting for what's theirs, representing a "guerrillero" build.
- the HEARTLAND is the new, fast and agressive league taking the global nations by storm with its flashy budget and stratetical management, more of a "theatrical" mindset.
- the PROMISED LAND are our absolute rebels, coming from the most culturally diverse backgrounds and walks of life,
ensuring their players are scarily vicious and rugged due to their geographical upbringing... the "outcast rebels" profile.
- the NORDIC ELITE, as the name implies, are the most elitist and insufferable of the nations (for good reasons, they kinda
invented this sport before spreading it around through colonization...) they represent our true "old guard" nation!

> ROUGHBALL ERAS represent the evolution of the sport across the global nations timeline!
- OLD TIMEY: an era before widespread coverage and communication prioritized consolidating the industry in its bare infancy,
focused on "bad-blood" rivalries, regional prestige, and "hood brawls". during the structural foundation of the sport on a regional
basis, much more emphasis was put onto the yearly championship for the RING!

- GOLDEN AGE: globalization and live television brought the peak of the sport, focusing on the scandals, controversies, superstars
and disgraces, along with a fresh new boiling pot of style and skill. with mass media coverage across hemispheres, it instantly
gave way for the global hype ensued regarding the CROWN DUEL overseas club wipeout brackets!

- MILLENIUM: the corporate era brought with itself a thrist for franchise capitalization and stats analytics, that simply re-invented
the industry into the brand new numbers game and asset trading roulette it has become now...  this new "venture capitalism" mindset 
shifted the market toward draft prospects and their potential trade value contributions to a franchise team roster!

- PANDEMICAL: a pandemic state forced the world into "spectator mode" in many ways... during the age of online streaming and fanatic engagement, now
viral "flashy" plays rule the viewership counts, along with this era being the most prodigial one recorded yet! the calibre of prestige, anticipation
and yearning for the FOUR NATIONS WORLD CUP every four years is what currently grew the access and coverage for this huge INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT!

> A player could do a "started from the bottom now we here" run, where they draft pull an 8 man roster of rookies 
(no stars at all) for the D4 BAKCYARD AMATEUR league, and abide to develop them throughout every single step of the career
stairway. after a year in the backyard, they can sign to a decent D3 HIGH SCHOOL PRO league, and "serve their time" for 2 
years, now finally earning a star... then moving up to a D2 COLLEGE SUPERSTAR league contract that ties them down for 3 years,
but grants instant 2 stars upon their promotion... finally reaching the D1 NATIONAL LEGENDS league, even reaching this stage is
a milestone, and the 4 seasons awaiting them are sure to be a charm if... (and when) they manage to survive, the hard earned and
long awaited VETERANCY STATUS awaits our roster, and now we have invaluable player assets that could wipeout entire regions, 
or simply go right back into their old backyard for "one last ride..."

* The striking DIVISIONAL contrast is what sets our prospects apart, based on recent promotions:
- BACKYARD AMATEURS are going full crackhead vibes while playing in muddy backyards and hanging out in shady
abandoned gyms or lockers as "team hangout" spots! just hope the water isn't too cold for a shower...
- HIGH SCHOOL PROS have a bit more budget for pitch maintenance, cheer squad and marching band, actual
team uniforms that get cleaned every now and then, even some decent locker rooms with running hot water!
- COLLEGE SUPERSTARS make a switch into full campus life, using their local university field with proper
stands for the fans and players personal dorm rooms as the chill "cooldown" spot or a decent PRIVATE bathroom.
- NATIONAL LEGENDS have it all sorted out in a way: huge regional stadiums, dedicated staff such as referees,
media agents and game comentarists or even pitch maintenance teams (yeah they have that motorized lawn mower
and everything) plus players enjoy "getting cozy" at their own personal apartments issued for camp living after
signing a franchise contract. now your 24/7 view of the field gets you pumped up to train everyday!

> This organic advancement made me wonder: what could happen if we could have DUAL THREAT players!?
- what if a pitch guard could double as a field general or viceversa? imagine a quarterback delivering a 
short kick pass to himself or other players before a perfect diamond pass across the field to acquire the try!
- what if air raiders doubled as scrimmagers and they could participate in defensive formations as extra wing
backs that can also catch a pass after the scrum or ruck has been cleared???
- what if a scrimmager was also a pitch guard? tackling you to death at a scrum and later punting the ball 
as far away from your leftover player corpses as possible!
- what if a field general was also an air raider? handing off a quick snap to the running back, 
but then running circles around the defense to reach the endzone again and deliver the try himself?
- what if an air raider started grinding their kicking skills to complete field goals after running passing routes?
- what if your classic scrimmager simply carried the ball and ran it while tackling the opponent's linemen like a plow...?

* This unique ability is reserved to VETERAN PLAYERS that are willing to play an extra season before retirement, 
either for their own team or a new franchise, and get "double-duties" regarding the match, but also double rewards!
these players are extremely valuable (if we had six stars ratings in the game, they would be it!,
therefore their market trading price is just as big...)

> As for the "positional coaches": there are none... a coach can have different coaching philosohpies or mindsets depending
on their background, and the "top" positional players or best rated prospects can strive to become "strategic advisors" regarding the
suit they are specialized in (that's why scrimmagers, field generals, pitch guards and air raiders all get a seat during press conferences or team meetings:
they have to act as positional captains and take accountability for mistakes (and praise as well) after being the best rated player for a suit in the roster.
there's no "captain" and no "offensive/defensive coordinator". the best two players, each representing a colored band on their biceps that shows you 
THEY are either DRIVING (red) or HOLDING (black) ADVISORS for their own head coach.

* After a veteran player RETIRES, they can take up coaching to enforce one of the following philosophies based on the DUAL THREAT COACHING ARCHETYPES:
J. PITCH GENERAL / "PLAY 4 KICKS": trickster playcalls that rely on kicking for points instead of just running the ball without a plan...
K. WING BACKER / "OLD SCHOOL": vintage mindset that relies on scrimmages and horizontal passing to break through towards endzone conversions!
Q. FIELD RAIDER / "PURE DRIVE": relentless playmaking and passing routes that ensure constant driving forward movement of the ball.
A. SCRUM GUARD / "PURE HOLD": clogging up the scrimmage line and forcing rucks to earn defensive possession dominates the holding game.
D. AIR PITCHER / "NEW SCHOOL": extreme verticality and fast-paced live-play due to strong pass-kicking skill pairings!
C. TACKLE CARRIER / "2 ROUGH BALLS": tackling everything that moves and just running the ball seems to work almost flawlessly sometimes...
* for this system i use a poker die, however a d6 works, otherwise stick to drafted dual threat veterans from card picks

* You see how these coaching philosophies represent the antithesis of each other? you either "play 4 kicks" or have "2 rough balls",
you either think "old school" or "new school", you prioritize either "pure drive" or "pure hold"...
you see how different teams and coaching styles could clash between each other within this system?

> The 8 man roster draft could have already gotten specialized backup roles (or even dual threar players) from the joker draft.
the 4 EXTRA players (backups players, x-factor assets for late games, extra specialists, hell you could even setup a 
backup roster based on entire suits and have a second "special teams" group ready to go) must be earned after a season,
and is the "most tradable" roster... a starter player moved to the backup leaves him up for trades if the teams are in need.
it becomes our collateral reserve, either saving or breaking a team based on the trade market...

* All cards pulled equal you got a player:
# 2 - 10 + suit: bottom position player based on suit
# face card + suit: top position player based on suit
# JKR + number card: corner position player based on suit
# JKR + face card: specialized dual threat veteran based on face card pull
# JKR + JKR: dual threat veteran with "free pick" regarding specialization

- I think we can now visualize how backup or "reserve" players work: the STARTER roster consists of our 8 main players and postions
(top + bottom) the BACKUP roster has 4 extra slots that could either be JKR (corner) position players, perhaps even dual threat veterans!!
or simply a "duplicate" 1 star running guard that came up in the last draft and is simply waiting for a star player injury for him
earn some match minutes! for newly founded/acquired clubs and franchises, the 4 man backup roster starts out empty, and teams must 
survive a full season up to the draft period in order to acquire their 4 picks for backup and special players!

- This allows our rosters to naturally "grow into" their star quality, leaving the "d6-1" formula to random draft
picks at the end of a season, and actually make players "developable" throughout their careers.

* When 9+ seasons are completed for a roster member then VETERANCY STATUS is acquired, and the "ONE LAST RIDE"
clause is fully in effect...! (now our 6 star players are organically sourced, not mathematically generated!)

(this also confirms that pulling a JKR itself is meaningless, until you actually pull the second card to see if you
got struck by a lucky lightning of veteran players, or simply a corner position specialist... i feel like teams even 
trade around their joker picks due to the sheer fear of pulling a bust, and some due to de desperation of looking for 
an x-factor veteran out in the market! the JKR card is just a "cash in" for a second card draw 
that determines the ACTUAL value of said JKR player)

* Regarding actual LIVE BALL MECHANICS, i needed to clarify the three different "domains" of play outcomes:
1. SCORING: reaching the endzone while carrying the ball grants a TRY, which is worth 5 pts and a possession flippage.
a FIELD GOAL can be triggered by a complication, or drawn into a playcall, and it grants instant 3 pts + neutral possession reset.
a SACK is only the result of a complication, but it is worth 2 pts + possession flippage (driving -> holding)
an INT is also a result of the "interception complication" and it grants and instant point + flippage (holding -> driving)

2. POSSESSION: roughball only features three possible formations based on the current state of the game:
* DRIVING = offensive routes (red suits) / HOLDING = defensive coverages (black suits) / NEUTRAL = combined playcalls (mixed suits)
- NEUTRAL formation is the "standarized" position nomenclature, and players only use the common abbreviations like QB or LB based on possession.

3. PLAY OUTCOMES: what actually "triggers" after the dice were rolled and there wasn't a clean winner! 
* DUAL SPLITS rolled would trigger complications and saving throws, a fumble must be followed with a re-audible, a stalemate requires a stat/card breaker!
- these should be treated as common "tabletop roleplaying" dice rolls: we have stat checks in the form of suit ratings and the breaker,
we use those same stats to roll a d6 saving throw and add your save modifiers, you can use your audible to trick teams, create signature plays, and so on...
- the rules allow for 2 TIMEOUTS, which represent "DECK RE-SHUFFLES" in game, as to enforce a "strategical reset" for the "mindset" of your imaginary players!
  (thus allowing actual DECK BURN, strategic timeouts to put the opponent at disadvantage, and a general MANAGEMENT layer to a simple "card draw loop")

4. GAME ASSETS: this proto-ball-sport can be played in the following four formats:
1. PHYSICAL TABLETOP ROLEPLAYING -> two separate 54 playing card decks, 2 pairs of D66 + d4 + d8 + coins and poker chips if you'd like +  a chessboard w/ 8 tokens per team.
2. TABLETOP SIMULATOR ENVIRONMENT -> a digitized but tactile version of the handbooks, printable spreadsheets, hand-drawn world maps, field mat and game assets required.
3. SIMULATED ASCII MATCHUPS -> computer environment that handles math, scoring and logs in quicktime fashion, as to ease the brain load put on the player to allow more roleplay!
4. ACTUAL GRASS? WITH AN ACTUAL BALL? -> if you manage to find 8/16 suckers who like getting hit and smelling bad, this conceptual game is actually entirely achievable IRL!
(ask my 9 year old self, who invented "tonto del rugby", a game that included a rugby ball being passed over the heads of you opponent (argentinian "tonto del medio" style) in
attempts to score a try or simply get rugby-tackled while trying! sounds familiar at all?? this is a childhood dream of mine being realized in a wholesome way... this world now exists!)
