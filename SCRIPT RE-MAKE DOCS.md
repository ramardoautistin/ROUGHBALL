# ROUGHBALL TABLETOP VS. ROUGHBALL ASCII
- HANDBOOK + TEMPLATES + GAME ASSETS | MATCH SIMULATION + CARDS & DICE MECHANICS
- FORMATIONS, TOKENS AND PLAY SCHEMES | ASCII GRAPHICS + PLAY OUTCOME COMMENTARY
- PLAYER RATINGS, TRAITS AND BACKGROUNDS | DYNASTY BUILDING + SOLO FRANCHISE RUN
- DYNASTY MANAGEMENT + LOGBOOK TRACKING | DRAFT SIMULATION + ROSTER MANAGEMENT

> DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
> 1. HONOR ORIGINAL MECHANICS IN THE ORIGINAL HANDBOOK.
> 2. FOCUS ON THE GAMEPLAY THE SCRIPT TRIED PROVIDING...
> 3. USE ACTUAL PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED WORKING LOGIC!

# BUILD SCHEDULE
1°. WEEKEND PROTOTYPE: simplest viable loop: "audible" play phases and resolution, quick match, 
basic card system and stat comparisons, d66 window working correctly, clean console output.
2°. WEEK SPRINT: dynasty mode foundation in the form of weekly activities, 12 week "year" structure,
match days across a week, actual bonuses/penalties for activities, functional special moves/playbook
3°. MONTH BUILD: persistent tabletop game companion, all championship and tournament modes, working draft
system w/ jkr special positions, dual threat veteran + star ratings for roster management

# MODES AND GAMEPLAY
 [1] QUICK MATCH -> input X amount of cards, resolve based on current team stats + division success window 
 following the mathematical ruling within the handbook, track scoring and posession flippages... to be always
 kept in mind however is that NO DOWNS OR YARDAGE ARE PRESENT IN ROUGHBALL! THIS IS A LIVE BALL GAME!!
 [2] FRANCHISE MODE -> log weekly activities, match results, bonuses and penalties to current stats, 
 calculate standings, track progression and "time" advancement for the REGIONAL BAD-BLOOD CHAMPIONSHIP RING.
 [3] THE DRAFT -> two "sub-modes" are present: drafting a full 8 man roster, and trading players around 
 if required in order to start a "brand new" franchise, or drafting 4 picks after the completion of a season 
 on DRAFT DAY as to update the value of a current roster, thus being also able to rebuild "unlucky" 
 previous drafts with new assets and trades from other teams based on their own picks!
 [4] FOUR NATIONS WORLD CUP -> an entirely separate game mode that simulates the 4-year process that involves 
 preparing for an international world cup of this calibre! the first year is simply simulated to determine 
 the previous loser (if the game was good, it would remember the previous loser!) and then proceed with the 
 drafting of the elite 8 man roster during the second year, along with a full third year of training camp & roster
 development, culminating on a fourth year actual FOUR NATIONS TOURNAMENT, following specific bracket structure.
 [5] CLUB WIPEOUT CROWN -> this is the only "orphan" game mode, because it requires you to run the "championship" 
 mode to see the actual best 4 teams per cardinal point within each nation before they qualify for the GLOBAL NATIONS
 OVERSEAS CROWN DUEL... (however they could just be randomized or cycled around lol)
 [6] SAVE & QUIT -> actually the most scary thing to implement is PLAYTHROUGH PERSISTENCE so that the game
 doesn't wipe everything away on every boot... but keeping track of the sheer amount of data this game generates 
 seems like a lot! keeping updated match recaps, draft reports and season summaries could get hefty.
