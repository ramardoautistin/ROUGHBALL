# POSITIONS

* SCRIMMAGERS:

(DT) defensive tackle: strongest member of the d-line. can stand ground better than anyone on the team.

(DE) defensive end: guards the corner of the d-line. can bull-rush the opposing d-line or stand ground at the snap.

(LB) linebacker: back of the d-line, responsible for guarding the end-zone.

* PITCH GUARDS:

(OG) offensive guard: center guard of the d-line, focused on tackling moving guards and rushers.

(OT) offensive tackle: center tackle of the d-line, takes care of extra protection in the form of a backup tackle. usually stands ground at the snap.

(CB) cornerback: responsible for guarding the corners of the end-zone, along with any "escapees" from the opposing team.

* FIELD GENERALS:

(QB) quarterback: responsible for the snap and all the play-making. calls plays and performs passes, runs and handoffs to offensive teammates.

(RB) running back: designated player for runs. expert ball protectors that can take more than a couple of tackles.

(SG) safety guard: moving tackles, responsible for blitz routes and trick-play defenses. can double as linebackers when needed.

> NEUTRAL FORMATION: (QG) quarter guard: backfield generals (RG) running guard: ball carriers and possession guards.

* AIR RAIDERS:

(WR) wide receiver: designated player for passes. impeccable hands and route running are required for the job.

(TE) tight end: extra corner-receiver that can also double as a moving tackle to protect receivers and backs in their runs.

(SG) safety guard: bonus routes, tackling backups, general player and possession control on the field.

> NEUTRAL FORMATION: (WB) wingback: corner routes and pass receivers (TB) tailback: flanker routes or carrier protectors.

* DUAL THREAT POSITIONS + COACHING PHILOSOPHIES
1. PITCH GENERAL: kicking + playcalling | "PLAY 4 KICKS" -> fun trickster playcalls that rely on kicking for points instead of just going for the run without a plan...
2. WING BACKER: tackling + reception | "OLD SCHOOL" -> vintage mindset that utilizes scrimmages and horizontal passing for endzone conversions.
3. FIELD RAIDER: handovers + routes | "PURE DRIVE" -> relentless playmaking and passing routes ensures a constant forward offensive movement of the ball!
4. SCRUM GUARD: rucking + box kicks | "PURE HOLD" -> clogging up the scrimmage line and forcing rucks to earn defensive possessions dominates the holding game!
5. AIR PITCHER: catching + goaling | "NEW SCHOOL" -> extreme verticality in live play due to strong and skilled pass-kicking pairings.
6. TACKLE CARRIER: scrimmage + carries | "2 ROUGH BALLS" -> tackling everything that moves and just running the ball tends to work flawlessly sometimes...
