[[ NATIONAL ROUGHBALL LEAGUE - COMPLETE MANAGEMENT SIMULATION SYSTEM ]]
### 1. PREMISE AND MECHANICAL FEATURES
> ROUGHBALL is a proto-ball game combining techniques and mechanics from
both its Rugby and American Football counterparts, while fixing "flow" 
issues present in both games, such as: the ban on the "forward pass"
established in rugby, the lack of "free punting" the ball in football,
plus the entire "yardage" and "downs" system which makes the games 
harder to watch. However, both sports contain fascinating rulings as well:
the playcalling and general strategy implied in american football (serving
as the basis for our ROUGHBALL simplified formation system) as well as our 
ZONE/RUN/BLITZ/PASS system which enhances the familiarity of play. Brought 
from rugby: the side pass, live ball & kicking mechanics, scrum and general 
constant scrimmages, PROPER tackling techniques, and field goal penalties 
granted for unsportsmanlike conducts between teams!

* ROUGHBALL effectively bridges the gap between strategically calling routes
or covers based upon the requirements of the current field, but focusing instead 
on live ball mechanics & perpetual possession "flippages" ensued during the match!

[ ROUGHBALL SCORING: TRY = 5pts | FIELD GOAL = 3pts | SACK = 2pts | INT = 1 pt ]

## SPECIAL MOVES & SIGNATURE PLAYBOOK (JKR ENFORCEMENT)
+----------+------------------+------------------------------------------+
| SUIT     | SPECIAL MOVE     | EFFECT                                   |
+----------+------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Clubs    | Ruck             | Scrimmage. Immediately play goes stale.  |
| Hearts   | Stiff Arm        | Force Move. Advance regardless of clash. |
| Spades   | Punt             | Ball strip becomes offensive punting!    |
| Diamonds | Juke Step        | Perfect Ankle Breaker. Reached Endzone!  |
+----------+------------------+------------------------------------------+

* PLAYS driven can be STORED into a team's PLAYBOOOK, the # of plays determined by current rank.
- Allows coaches to callout SIGNATURE PLAYS on any JKR drawn (engaging a SLOT #, without further cards).

### 2. PLAY CYCLE & POSSESSION
* PHASE I: THE AUDIBLE
  - Players reveal their plays simultaneously.
  - Formation: Set based on suit and current position (Neutral/Offense/Defense)
  - Possession: Hearts/Diamonds = Offense. Clubs/Spades = Defense.
* PHASE II: THE CLASH (D66)
  - Calculate Hits based on Rank Success Window. Stats only affect TIE-BREAKERS!
    - I. Unranked Rookies:   1 Success Window    | 1 DIVISION FLOOR STAT (Unranked Prospect)
    - II. Backyard Amateurs: 1-2 Success Window  | 2 DIV FLOOR STAT (D4 Amateur)
    - III. High School Pros:    1-3 Success Window  | 3 DIV FLOOR STAT (D3 Pro)
    - IV. College Superstars: 1-4 Succes Window | 4 DIV FLOOR STAT (D2 Superstar)
    - V. National Legends:   1-5 Success Window  | 5 DIV FLOOR STAT (D1 Legend)
   * SKILL POINTS follow division promotions: calculate total SKILL POOL based on (ROSTER ☆ BONUS // 2).
   * Leagues like the IRBL focus on a HIT/MISS system reliant on EVEN/ODD calculations.
* PHASE III: RESOLUTION
  - Clean Win: Highest hits wins. Play advancement or conversion.
  - The Stale: Hits match. Proceed to "THE BREAKER".
  - Dual-Split: Both roll [1 Hit / 1 Miss]. Trigger D4 Complication!
  - Fumble (XX): Both roll [0 Hits]. Ball is live! RE-AUDIBLE!.

### 3. THE BREAKER (STAT-BASED STALEMATE SCRAMBLER)
* Rule: Only add card values if primary stats are equal.
  1. Compare Primary Stats: Higher stat wins the tie-breaker.
  2. Card Value Addition (If stats are equal): [Primary Stat] + [Card Value].
     - 2-10: Face Value
     - J: 11 (Feint Play / T Formation)
     - Q: 12 (Side Pass / Y Formation)
     - K: 13 (Kick Pass / V Formation)
     - A: 14 (Spread Form)
     - JKR: 15 (SPECIAL MOVES TABLE! when combined with specific SUIT.)
  3. Final Saving Throw: If still tied, compare Saving Throw rolls + outcome.
- SOMEHOW STILL TIED? Draw a new RE-AUDIBLE PLAY for a clean tie-breaker!

### 4. D4 COMPLICATIONS (DUAL-SPLIT MISS TABLE)
* Logic: Lower Saving Throw ROLL (BASE ST + ROLL d6) results in being offender/offendee.
  - [1] SACK (Check SPD): Instant posession FLIP + 2 pts for "sacker".
  - [2] OUT OF BOUNDS (Check CAT): Reset play to NEUTRAL.
  - [3] PENALTY (Check STA): Personal Foul triggers Field Goal: +3pt.
  - [4] INTERCEPTION (Check KCK): Instant possession FLIP for live play + 1pt.
